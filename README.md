# Ray-Tracing
Codes to Perform seismic ray tracing with Physics Informed Neural Networks
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Velocity.py trains a neural network to provide the velocity at coordiates between 0 and 1.

ray_tracing.py & mul_ray.py then train a physics informed neural network to ray trace in the desired velocity field
